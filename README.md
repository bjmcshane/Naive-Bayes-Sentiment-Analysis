# Naive-Bayes-Sentiment-Analysis
Naive bayes sentiment analysis perormed using both maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori approaches.

This was a programming project in my graduate level machine learning class at Indiana University. It's very similar to spam vs non-spam email classification Naive Bayes programs I've written in the past, here however I was working with positive and negative move reviews from amazon, imdb, and yelp. This assignment also required the use of cross-validation.
